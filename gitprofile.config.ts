      description: 'Hello! I\'m Holden (Hung) Nguyen. I\'m a DevOps/SRE engineer from Vietnam.\n\n' +
        'üî≠ After spending more than five years working in the mechanical engineering field at Intel Vietnam, I decided it was time for a career change. During that time, I was focused on using LEAN principles and innovation to improve operational efficiency, I notice how much the world was being transformed by software, particularly in the mechanical industry. That realization led me to join an internal mentoring program in 2021, where I had the opportunity to meet with a principal engineer of Intel\'s IoT Group from the US. During our one-on-one meetings, we delved into the world of IoT and its related concepts, including connectivity broadcasting, security, micro-services, and DevOps culture. This experience was a turning point for me, as it inspired me to become a DevOps/SRE engineer and work towards growing into roles such as MLOps/DataOps/AIOps.\n\n' +
        'üå± This shift was more than a career pivot‚Äîit marked the beginning of my specialization in cutting-edge areas like DevSecOps. My successful transition culminated at OPSWAT Vietnam, where I excelled as an SRE, managing the Metadefender Cloud Platform/API. Here, my role not only deepened my expertise in cybersecurity and infrastructure but also underscored my continuous research and development within the software field.\n\n' +
        'üëØ One of the methods I\'ve found to be particularly effective is sharing what I learn with others. By doing so, not only am I able to better organize my own knowledge, but I\'m also able to communicate with others and reinforce my own understanding while correcting any misunderstandings along the way.',
